# Teatime

A brief introduction to using RSpec and Feature Testing in `irb` to build a simple system to mimic teatime.

### Features

- Teapot can pour tea into a cup
- Cup can be full or empty
- Cup becomes full when tea is poured into the cup :construction:

### Instructions

The last feature is incomplete, and requires that we give the `Cup` class some _state_. How can we solve the final failing test?
